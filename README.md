Limited Edition Stablecoin Protocol: Stablecoins with limited supply to become **collectibles.**

Such Stablecoins have a strongly limited initial supply without minting function, only burning function.

The rarity makes them albeit being fungible a collectible almost like non fungible.
That means such a Limited Edition mStable is something between fungible and non fungible. It
was just the missing part since the NFT wave has flooded the cryptospace:
